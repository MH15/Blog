Thanks to these folks and their amazing open source projects! Without their great work, Panel would not be possible.

For the server:
* [HapiJS](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) we just prefer it over Express. A lot. Also, [Inert](https://github.com/hapijs/inert), [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi), and [Yar](https://github.com/hapijs/yar)
* [EJS](https://github.com/mde/ejs) provides a templating engine that's simple and powerful
* [FuseJS](https://github.com/krisk/Fuse) is literally the smoothest fuzzy-search engine ever
* [node.bcrypt.js](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js) driver for one of the most renowned hashing algorithms, helping us keep Panel secure
* [Remarkable](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable) by Jon Schlinkert solidly and consistently renders markdown at \*remarkable\* speeds
* [node-directory-tree](https://github.com/mihneadb/node-directory-tree) creates a JSON representation of the current file structure 

For the frontend:
* [HighlightJS](https://highlightjs.org) syntax highlighting for code embeds in articles
* [Color Thief](https://lokeshdhakar.com/color-thief/) by Lokesh Dhakar analyzes an image and returns the predominant color palette
* [JSONEditor](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor) blows every JSON editor ever out of the water
* [SimpleMDE](https://simplemde.com/) WYSIWUG editor for everyone's favorite markup language
* [TreeView](https://github.com/justinchmura/js-treeview) was literally the only available option, but turned out to be incredible


For development:
* [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) makes development easier
